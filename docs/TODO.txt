TODO
----

- Correct list styles: everything is exported as bullet-list for the
  moment. This implies to generate a style per list;

- Fix paragraph style correctly in list: they have to inherit from
  list style as well;

- Fix path used to images: it's not unique and there is conflict. We
  should use asset id instead of path, but there is no reference to
  the asset id in the doc:image;

- We may parse Fig n. of image and replace it to real illustration n,
  which can let us make a table of figures;

- Image are not included in the export when you export only a document
  (it's not included in the Silva XML);

- For doc:pre we should convert space to fixed tabs, and add line
  feed (there is no pre-like in ODF);

- Export metadata of the first document/publication in meta.xml of the
  ODF;

- We may parse correctly doc:index and make a index at the end of the
  document;

- Don't known how, but add some test.
